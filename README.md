# Yewordle

[Live demo](https://yewordle.geekpie.club)

A Yew implementation of the [Wordle game](http://www.wordle.net/). This is just for fun and doesn't aim to 100% replicate the original.

You can make your own Wordle and send it to friends by base64-encoding a word and include it as the URL query, e.g. [https://yewordle.geekpie.club/?YmxpbXA=](https://yewordle.geekpie.club/?YmxpbXA=) (this will also allow words that are not in the dictionary.)

This repository is open sourced for learning purposes only - the original creator(s) of Wordle own all applicable rights to the game itself.
